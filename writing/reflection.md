## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TODO` with your response.

### First Tool

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 The AUGUSTUS tool is used to predict genes in eukaryote genome sequences.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 This tool has undergone species specific training sets to predict genes. It creates results based on predictions determined by training.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 The AUGUSTUS tool provides an easy way for gene prediction, particularly for genome annotation projects. This is due to the fact that this tool is easily accessible for free online via a web server, as well as also being available for download.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
 cDNA sequences can be uploaded together by users with the genomic DNA, which can be used to improve the gene prediction. If inaccurate data is uploaded, the results of gene prediction could be skewed.


### Second Tool

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 QIIME is a bioinformatics pipeline that is utilized for performing microbiome analysis from raw DNA sequencing data.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 This tool creates publication quality graphics and statistics from user-generated raw sequencing data. This process includes: diversity analyses and visualizations, OTU picking, taxonomic assignment, demultiplexing and quality filtering, as well as phylogenetic reconstruction.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 QIIME is an open-source tool. This allows for users to accurately represent data that was generated from Illumina or other platforms in a visual form.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
 This tool is accessed via the command line. With those that are not tech-savvy or those that have trouble following the tutorials, user error could report in inaccurate graphical data.
